"""
in the starting code,you'll find the solution from the leap year challenge.First convert
this function is_leap() so that instead of printing "Leap year" or "not leap year" it should return
true if it is a leap year and return false if it is not a leap year

you are then going to create a function called days_in_month() which will take a year and a month
as inputs,

eg: days_in_month(year=2022,month=2)

and it will use this information to work out the number of days in the month then return that as output

eg: 28

the list month_days contains the number of days ina month from january to december for a non-leap year.A leap year 
has 29 days in february
